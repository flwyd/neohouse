    <strong>Sorry, but it doesn't look like you qualified for a Staff Credential or Reduced-Price Ticket.</strong>
    The thresholds for qualifying for a Staff Credential or Reduced-Price Ticket in 2017 based on your volunteer
    credits in 2016 were: 19.00 credits for a Reduced-Price Ticket and 38.00 credits for a Staff Credential.
  </p>
{{else}}
  {{#if (gt ticketCount 1)}}
    <p>
      <span class="text-danger">You're a rare one: you qualify for more than one ticket or credential!</span>
      Usually this happens because you banked a ticket/credential and then ended up attending the event using
      a gift or purchased ticket and worked some Ranger shifts and qualified for a second ticket/credential.
      For reference, the tickets/credentials we have for you are:
      <ul>
        {{#each ticketList as |ticket|}}
          <li>A {{ticket.typeHuman}} from {{ticket.source_year}}</li>
        {{/each}}
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've automatically chosen the oldest of these for you to use below. If you
      want to use one of your other banked tickets, please email
      {{mail-to (config 'TAS_Email')}} and let us know and we can make that happen!
    </p>
  {{/if}}

  <p>
    <strong>Congratulations - {{congratSentence}}</strong>
      We're pleased to inform you that you've qualified for a {{myTicket.typeHuman}}
      based on your volunteering in {{myTicket.source_year}}
  </p>

  {{#if (eq mode 'view')}}
  <p>
    For now, there's nothing more you need to do. Information about how to
    claim your ticket (or bank it, if you're not planning to go to the Burn
    this year) will be available in June or early July.
  </p>
  {{else if (eq myTicket.status 'submitted')}}
    <p>
      Your {{myTicket.humanType}} has been submitted to the Burning Man
      Ticket Request System, and you should have received an email from
      Ticketfly informing you about it.  You cannot request changes to it
      via the Secret Clubhouse at this time.  If you urgently need to make
      a change, please email {{mail-to (config 'TAS_Email')}} and they may
      be able to help.
