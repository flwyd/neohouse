<p>
Your account has been (somewhat) disabled because you seem to have
fallen out of our volunteer application process.  Likely this is because you
applied to become a Ranger in a prior year but have not reapplied for this
year.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in volunteering with the Black Rock Rangers on playa this year,
please email {{mail-to (config 'GeneralSupportEmail')}} and we'll get things sorted out for you.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in auditing a Black Rock Ranger training but don't
intend to become a Black Rock Ranger on playa this year, please also email
rangers@burningman.org and let us know that.

You will not be able to sign up for trainings or shifts until
we get your account sorted out.

Thanks,<br>
